# Driver Assistance System for Collision Detection

Developed a real-time collision avoidance system using STM32 microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, CAN bus communication, and FreeRTOS. The system monitors the distance to nearby obstacles, processes the data in realtime, and provides visual and auditory alerts via an LCD and buzzer, enhancing vehicle safety by delivering timely warnings to the driver.
