# CANShield: Collision Avoidance Protocol
Developed a real-time collision avoidance system that monitors both rear and front distances using
STM32F407VGT6 microcontrollers, MCP2551 CAN transceivers, ultrasonic sensors, and FreeRTOS.
The system enhances vehicle safety by providing real-time visual and auditory alerts to prevent
collisions based on the distance to obstacles in front of and behind the vehicle
